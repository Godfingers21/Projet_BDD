    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: May 21, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        At Kaya, we believe that transparency is essential to the relationship of trust between us 
        and our users. This privacy policy aims to provide you with a clear, comprehensive and accessible 
        explanation of how we handle your personal data. Surfing a site, buying a product or even just browsing 
        our catalog generates digital interactions that we take seriously. As a result, every piece of data we 
        collect has a defined purpose and is governed by appropriate security measures. We undertake never to use 
        your information improperly or for unauthorized commercial purposes. This policy is part of our commitment 
        to comply with French, European (RGPD) and international best practice regulations on data protection. 
        By using Kaya, you accept these rules and can consult them at any time via the link at the bottom of the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      This policy applies to all information collected through our website, applications, and any other services
      or interactions you may have with Kaya. By accessing or using our services, you agree to the practices
      described in this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We collect different types of information to provide and improve our services. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> When you create an account, place an order, or contact support, we collect your name, email address, shipping address, billing information (only the last 4 digits of your card), and any other information you choose to provide.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We automatically collect technical information such as your IP address, browser type, pages visited, time spent on the site, device type, and interaction data.</li>
      <li><strong>Cookies & Tracking:</strong> We use cookies, pixels, and similar technologies to recognize you on return visits, personalize content, and analyze our website traffic.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When you create an account on Kaya, we record the data necessary to identify you and enable you to benefit from our services. This includes your surname, first name, e-mail address, encrypted password, delivery address and order history. At the same time, technical information is automatically collected: device type, browser, IP address, time zone, pages visited, time spent, clicks and interactions. This data enables us to optimize the user experience, detect abnormal behavior (fraud, bots), and ensure the site's technical compatibility on all media. Optionally, if you enable marketing cookies, we can also collect your preferences to offer you personalized content (game recommendations, targeted offers). You can view or modify these settings at any time from your profile.
    </p>
    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
All the data we collect is used strictly within the framework of the services we offer: order processing, customer account management, sending of transactional notifications, assistance, and continuous improvement of our site. They are also used for anonymized statistical analysis, enabling us to better understand purchasing behavior, adjust our catalog, or anticipate customer needs according to season or region. When you contact us by form or e-mail, we also keep a record of your exchanges to ensure consistent follow-up. No data will be used for external canvassing or passed on to third-party advertisers. In the event of a promotion, competition or partnership, we will clearly inform you of the purpose and ask for your explicit consent if third parties are involved.  
</p>

    <h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
    <p>
Kaya works with trusted partners only when they are essential to the smooth running of the service. This includes payment providers (Stripe, PayPal), carriers (La Poste, Mondial Relay), data hosts (OVH, AWS), and our analytics tools (Google Analytics, Matomo). Each service provider is selected on the basis of strict compliance criteria (RGPD, ISO27001) and can only use your data within the scope of the contract signed. We have written subcontracting agreements that impose the same level of confidentiality that we respect internally. No service provider can sell or reuse your data. If we involve a new player, we will update this policy. Apart from these cases, your data will never be transmitted unless we are obliged to do so by law (judicial decision, proven fraud, criminal investigation).    </p>

    <h2>5. Sharing of Personal Data</h2>
    <p>
La durée pendant laquelle nous conservons tes données dépend de leur nature et de l’usage prévu. Les informations relatives aux commandes sont conservées pendant une durée de 5 ans à compter de la date d’achat, conformément aux obligations fiscales et comptables. Les comptes inactifs (aucune connexion ni commande) sont automatiquement anonymisés ou supprimés après 36 mois. Tes e-mails, messages ou demandes de support sont archivés 2 ans maximum pour un suivi optimal. Tu peux demander à tout moment la suppression de ton compte depuis l’espace personnel. Dans ce cas, nous supprimons ou anonymisons tes données sauf celles que la loi nous oblige à conserver (factures, preuves de paiement). Une fois supprimées, ces données ne sont plus accessibles ni récupérables.
</p>
    <h2>6. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        We implement technical and organizational means to ensure a high level of protection for your data. This includes encrypted exchanges (HTTPS), secure storage (French servers), daily encrypted backups, double authentication for our employees and regular audits. Passwords are hashed and salted, never stored in clear text. Our databases are partitioned and monitored 24/7. Internally, only authorized employees have access to the data required for their job (principle of "least privilege"). We regularly test our site against known vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injections, CSRF). If a vulnerability is detected, we have an immediate response protocol and inform the users concerned within a maximum of 72 hours.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
As a user, you benefit from rights guaranteed by the RGPD: right of access (to consult data), right of rectification (to correct an error), right to erasure (to delete your account), right to portability (to receive a copy in a readable format), and right of objection (to refuse processing). You can exercise these rights via the "Privacy" section of your profile or by sending an e-mail to privacy@kaya-boardgames.com. We undertake to reply within 30 days, except in complex cases. If you feel that your rights have not been respected, you can contact the CNIL (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés) or take legal action. We'll do everything we can to avoid this happening, and we're here to listen to you in all circumstances.    </p>


    <h2>8. Security Measures</h2>
    <p>
      At Kaya, we are deeply committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your personal data. Our security measures go beyond basic compliance and are reviewed regularly to stay ahead of evolving threats. All sensitive transactions are protected with state-of-the-art SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption, ensuring that data exchanged between your browser and our servers remains private. We also implement tokenization for payment data, meaning your full card number is never stored on our servers. Access to personal data is strictly controlled through a role-based permission system, with logging and auditing to monitor activity. Our infrastructure is hosted in ISO 27001-certified environments with real-time monitoring. Employees undergo mandatory security training, including phishing awareness and data minimization protocols. We also conduct regular penetration tests and vulnerability assessments with third-party experts to identify and mitigate any potential risks before they can be exploited.    
    </p>

    <h2>9. Cookies & Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      Kaya uses cookies not just for functionality, but also to enhance your experience, personalize content, and understand how our site is used. Cookies are small data files stored on your device that allow us to remember your session, shopping cart items, preferences, and login status across multiple visits. We categorize our cookies into essential (which are required to make the site work), performance (used for statistical analysis), and targeting (used to serve relevant offers or ads). By default, only essential cookies are activated, and we ask for your explicit consent before enabling others. Our analytics are primarily powered by Google Analytics, which helps us track page performance, load speeds, bounce rates, and visitor behavior — all in an aggregated, non-identifiable manner. You can opt out of analytics cookies at any time using our cookie consent banner or through your browser settings. For more control, you may use browser plugins or privacy modes to block cookies or delete them after each session.
    </p>

    <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Although Kaya’s core infrastructure and data storage are hosted within the European Union, specifically in France, some of our service providers and partners operate in jurisdictions outside of the EU. This includes, but is not limited to, email delivery services such as SendGrid, payment processors like Stripe, and cloud-based error reporting tools. While data transferred outside of the EU may be subject to foreign laws, we ensure all such transfers are covered under recognized legal frameworks. These include the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), and Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs). We work only with vendors who commit contractually to uphold GDPR-equivalent protections for data access, retention, and security. Additionally, where required, we conduct transfer impact assessments and maintain logs of data flow. We do not sell or transfer your data to any organization located in countries lacking adequate legal protections without clear safeguards and your informed consent.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Kaya is not designed for use by children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect, process, or store personal information from minors. In accordance with the GDPR and other global privacy laws, children under 16 require verified parental or guardian consent before any processing of personal data can occur. If we discover that a child has created an account, submitted personal data, or made purchases without the appropriate consent, we will take immediate action to delete the data and block access to the account. If you are a parent or legal guardian and believe your child may have interacted with our platform improperly, we encourage you to reach out to our privacy team at privacy@kaya-boardgames.com. We will act swiftly to resolve the matter and provide you with details of the information removed. Our commitment is to ensure that all our services respect the boundaries of age-appropriate content and legal compliance in every jurisdiction where we operate.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
     From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in laws, regulations, technological developments, or internal practices. These updates may be minor clarifications or significant adjustments that affect how your data is used and protected. We commit to notifying you in advance of any material changes via email, on our homepage, or through an in-site banner. You will always have the opportunity to review the revised version before continuing to use our services. Continued usage of Kaya after the policy change constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms. For transparency, previous versions of this Privacy Policy will remain accessible via a version archive on our site. We encourage users to review the policy periodically to stay informed about how we handle personal data and to ensure that they are comfortable with our practices. If you disagree with any of the changes, you may exercise your right to delete your account and request the removal of your data.
